# Logistics-Dataset-Analysis
Logistics Dataset Analysis Using SQL

This project presents an end-to-end SQL-based analysis of a logistics company’s operations, focusing on customer behavior, shipment patterns, employee distribution, and payment insights. The analysis uses structured queries on a relational database to derive actionable business insights for both domestic and international logistics operations 

Logistics Dataset Analysis

.

📌 Project Overview

The logistics company operates across domestic and international markets, managing shipments, payments, employees, and customer memberships. The objective of this project is to optimize logistics operations by analyzing structured data using MySQL queries.

Key goals include:

Understanding customer preferences

Evaluating shipment domains and service types

Analyzing payment behavior and revenue patterns

Assessing employee distribution for operational efficiency

🗂️ Dataset & Database Schema

The dataset is organized into multiple relational tables, including:

customer – Customer details and type

payment_details – Payment amount, mode, and status

shipment_details – Shipment domain, service type, weight, and charges

status – Shipment dates and delivery status

employee_details – Employee designation and branch

employee_manages_shipment – Shipment responsibility mapping

membership – Customer membership duration

A complete ER / database schema diagram is included in the file (Page 3) illustrating relationships between all tables

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Database: MySQL

SQL Concepts Used:

JOIN

GROUP BY

WHERE

Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX)

Date calculations (DATEDIFF, ROUND)

📊 Analysis & Key Insights

The project answers 12 business-driven SQL questions, including:

Customer Insights

Retail customers form the largest segment (39%)

Domestic shipments slightly exceed international shipments

Express service is preferred over regular service

Payment Insights

Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most used payment mode (53%)

Paid vs unpaid payments are evenly split

COD transactions have higher average payment values than card payments

Employee & Operations Insights

Delivery roles have the highest employee count

Texas (TX) has the highest number of employees among branches

Long-term customers (10+ years membership) form a significant base

Shipment Insights

Domestic shipments have a higher average weight than international

The highest shipment charge recorded is 1486, paid by a customer named Marie

All queries are accompanied by SQL code snippets and summarized insights throughout the document
